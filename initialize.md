The app won't be quite running properly after you've installed everything. That's because you need to add this file in your app/config folder.

```
config.json - grab your Firebase Credentials
{
    "API_KEY": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "AUTH_DOMAIN": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "DATABASE_URL": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "PROJECT_ID": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "STORAGE_BUCKET": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "MESSAGING_SENDER_ID": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "APP_ID": "<FILL ME IN>",
    "MEASUREMENT_ID": "<FILL ME IN>"
  }

```
